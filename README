S7nodave for EPICS
   Device support and driver for EPICS communication with S7 PLCs 
================================================================================

ABOUT
-----

S7nodave is a device support and driver for using S7 PLCs with an EPICS IOC,
which is based on libnodave (http://libnodave.sourceforge.net/).

Using s7nodave, you can read variables from or write data to the PLC using the 
ISO on TCP protocol. You only have to specify the memory address and data-type
for each item you want to read or write.


A WORD OF CAUTION
-----------------

When using this software to connect to a PLC, disconnect ALL external equipment
from the PLC before trying to establish a connection.

This software can overwrite variables in the PLC memory or even parts of the
program running in the PLC. Therefore outputs of the PLC might show 
unpredictable behavior.

There are a lot of different PLC types and depending on the type of the PLC, its
configuration, the type of the host machine used for the EPICS IOC, the host 
machine's configuration and the EPICS IOC's configuration, this software might 
have very different, potentially unwanted results.

It is always the responsibility of the user using this software to ensure, that
its use is safe and complies with local regulation BEFORE connecting any 
equipment to the PLC. Violations of this rules might result in equipment being
damaged or even PERSONS BEING INJURED by misbehaving equipment.


COMPILING
---------

You need to edit the configure/RELEASE file and set the paths to match the
locations of your EPICS base and Asyn installation directories.

S7nodave for EPICS also has (compile-time) dependencies on some headers from the
Boost C++ library (http://www.boost.org/). If these headers are not installed in
one of the default locations (usually /usr/include and /usr/local/include), you
have to add the Boost directory to the compiler flags. Please have a look at the 
corresponding line in configure/RELEASE for an example. s7nodave for EPICS was
originally compiled against version 1.47 of the Boost library, but it might also
work with newer versions of this library. Boost itself does not need to be 
compiled, the header files just have to be present.

As libnodave is bundled with s7nodave for EPICS, there is no need to compile
libnodave separately. It will be compiled and placed in the lib directory
automatically when running make.


USING THE DEVICE SUPPORT / DRIVER
---------------------------------

In order to use the device support and driver in an IOC, you have to add the
line

S7NODAVE=/path/to/s7nodave

to the configure/RELEASE file of your IOC application. Assuming your IOC 
application name is "xxx", you also have to add the two lines

xxx_DBD += s7nodave.dbd
xxx_LIBS += s7nodave

to the file xxxApp/src/Makefile.

You can the use DTYP "s7nodave" for most record types. The device addresses
have the form "@myPLC IB0" where "myPLC" is the name of a port created using

s7nodaveConfigureIsoTcpPort("myPLC", "s7plc.local.marsching.com", 0, 0, 0)

in iocBoot/iocxxx/st.cmd and "IB0" is a memory address in the usual S7 notation.

Please see the extended documentation in the docs directory for more detailed
information about how to use s7nodave for EPICS.
