* Version 2.1.3 (December 11th, 2017)
- Fixed a bug in S7nodavePortDriver::sendRequestToPlc which caused a request to
  read items to grow too large. This would happen when an item's data would
  still fit into a request, but its four byte header would not. Now, the code
  checks whether both an item's data and header fit into a request before adding
  it.

* Version 2.1.2 (November 15th, 2017)
- Fix a bug in S7nodavePortDriver::sendRequestToPlc which caused a request to
  read items to grow too large when items with odd sizes were read. The PLC adds
  a padding byte to the data of such items and this padding byte was not
  considered when calculating the size of the resulting PDU, so that the
  maximum PDU size was sometimes exceeded.

* Version 2.1.1 (November 24th, 2016)
- Fixed a bug in the S7nodavePortDriver class that caused an exception to be
  thrown when a bit was written and a log message (in case of error or when
  the debug mode was enabled) was generated.
- Fixed a bug in the S7nodavePortDriver class that could cause an infinite loop
  when reading multiple items.
- Fixed a bug in the S7nodavePortDriver that could cause too many items to be
  requested at once, leading to a read error. This could happen because the code
  only verified that the expected response would not exceed the maximum PDU
  size, but the corresponding check for the request size was incorrect.

* Version 2.1.0 (June 23rd, 2016)
- Changed the handling of the NOBT field for mbbi, mbbo, mbbiDirect, and
  mbboDirect records. Since EPICS 3.15.4, the NOBT field is of type epicsUInt16
  for mbbi and mbbo records. The s7nodave device support can now deal with both
  signed and unsigned typesfor the NOBT field. The device support does not
  overwrite the MASK field any longer if NOBT is equal to the number of bits of
  the PLC data type. However, MAKS is still set to zero if NOBT is greater than
  the number of bits of the PLC data type.

* Version 2.0.1 (August 7th, 2015)
- Fixed a bug in the S7nodavePortDriverReadOptimizer class that could cause a
  segmentation fault due to the dereference of an iterator that pointed to the
  end of a list.
- Fixed a bug in the definition of the s7nodaveConfigureIsoTcpPort iocsh
  command that would allow the command to be called with too few arguments. This
  bug was introduced with the 2.0.0 release.
- Allow the user to locally override paths and setting without modifying RELEASE
  or CONFIG_SITE by including a RELEASE.local and CONFIG_SITE.local if present.

* Version 2.0.0 (February 8th, 2015):
- Changed the initialization code so that a rack and slot number for the PLC can
  be specified.
- Changed the address parsing code so that bit addresses in data blocks are
  correctly written as DB###.DBX##.#. Before, they had to be written as
  DB###.DB##.# (no X).

* Version 1.0.3 (April 24th, 2014)
- Fixed a bug in the device support routine for the stringout record, where a
  cast to a wrong structure type resulted in the record address not being read
  correctly. Thanks go to Marko Volk (Cosylab) for reporting this bug and
  submitting a patch.
- Fixed a bug in the parsing routine for PLC addresses, that caused timer and
  counter addresses with a single digit number to be rejected. Thanks go to
  Marko Volk (Cosylab) for reporting this bug.
- Added support for specifying a poll-group for analog input records (this was
  accidentally deactivated for this record type).
- Fixed a bug that caused the PLC connection to stay locked, if the
  initialization of an output record failed.
- Fixed a bug in libnodave that caused problems when trying to write to counter
  or timer addresses.
- Fixed a bug in the trace functions of the driver, which would check the
  trace-IO mask where the trace mask would have been appropriate.
- Fixed a bug in the stringin and stringout record, that cause only the first
  five bytes to be transmitted.

* Version 1.0.2 (January 21st, 2013)
- Fixed a bug that caused a non-zero value to be returned for a boolean that was
  read from the first bit of an address, when this bit was zero but other bits
  at the address were non-zero.

* Version 1.0.1 (December 17th, 2012)
- Fixed a bug that caused an IOC crash on initialization, when an ao record was
  used with a float-type in the PLC. This also fixed a bug that did not
  correctly deactivate conversion when using an ai record with a float-type in
  the PLC.
- Removed unused variables that caused compiler warnings.

* Version 1.0.0 (January 28th, 2012)
- First release of s7nodave.
